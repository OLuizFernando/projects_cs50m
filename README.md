# CS50M Projects Repository
Welcome to my repository of projects from Harvard's CS50M course! Here, youâ€™ll find my solutions to the exercises and practical problems I encountered throughout the course. This repository is a way to share knowledge, enhance skills in mobile app development with React Native, and collaborate with other students.
